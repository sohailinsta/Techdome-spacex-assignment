# SpaceX Launch Programs

This project is a web application that displays information about SpaceX launch programs. Users can filter the launches based on launch years and view details such as mission name, mission ID, launch year, launch success, and landing success.

## Project Approach

The project was developed using a component-based approach with React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The main components include:

Dashboard: The main component that fetches and displays the SpaceX launch data, handles filtering based on launch years, and implements pagination.
Card: A reusable component that represents a single launch card, displaying information about each launch.

The project follows the following steps:

Fetching Data: The project uses the Axios library to make HTTP requests to the SpaceX API and retrieve the launch data.
Data Filtering: Users can filter the launches by selecting a specific launch year. The filtered data is updated in real-time, and the pagination is reset accordingly.
Pagination: To enhance the user experience and improve performance, the launches are paginated, with a specified number of cards displayed per page.
Responsive Design: The user interface is designed to be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes and devices using CSS media queries.

## Tech Stack

The project utilizes the following technologies and libraries:

React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Axios: A popular HTTP client for making API requests.
CSS: Cascading Style Sheets for styling the components and creating the layout.
GitHub: Version control and code repository for managing the project's source code.
GitHub Pages: A feature of GitHub that allows hosting the project and making it accessible online.
